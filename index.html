    <h2> Assignment 1 - Interactive Experience Research</h2>
        <body>For my selection task, I chose 'Orb Farm' by Max Bittker</body>
        <br>
        <a href=”https://orb.farm”>https://orb.farm</a>
      
    <h2>Week 2</h2>
    <h4>1) Spend two minutes with the experience and list all of your actions in granular detail.</h4>
    
    <ul style=“list-style-type:square”>
        <li>Read info and clicked ‘next’ until the tutorial was complete</li>
        <li>Dragged cursor across screen while clicking down to dispense sand</li>
        <li>Dragged cursor across screen while clicking down to dispense water/li>
        <li>Dragged cursor across screen while clicking down to dispense Daphnia</li>
        <li>Dragged cursor across screen while clicking down to dispense Algae</li>
        <li>Clicked to dispense fish</li>
        <li>Clicked to dispense other fish (goldfish)</li>
        <li>Clicked the info button for help/objective</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>2) What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</h4>

    <ul style=“list-style-type:square”>
        <li>The sprite on the left of the window that talks to you at the start reminded me of Pokemon</li>
        <li>I then paid attention to the background as I saw the sun setting</li>
        </ul>

    <h4>3) What did you spend the most time engaging with?</h4>

    <ul style=“list-style-type:square”>
        <li>Dragging and clicking elements into the big round bowl in the centre of the screen</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>4) What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</h4>

    <ul style=“list-style-type:square”>
        <li>Clicking and dragging components into the activity area. For example, dispensing the fish and seeing if they ate at the Algae or Daphnia.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>5) What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</h4>

    <ul style=“list-style-type:square”>
        <li>I think the objective is to create a little digital ecosystem to explore how bacteria and animals interact with their habitats</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>6) How does the experience communicate it's primary goal?</h4>

    <ul style=“list-style-type:square”>
        <li>The tutorial screen gives you the directive to dispense water, sand, daphnia and algae but doesn’t tell you anything beyond that. After those directives are met, the experience doesn’t encourage you to test any further. It presents elements for you to play with but has no info on their application in the experience until you visit the info window which provides a convoluted and mostly unhelpful description of what’s available to you - still without communicating a goal to you. Perhaps the goal was to experiment and interact?</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>7) What is your impression of the intended length of a single interaction and how often you are intended to interact with the experience?</h4>
    
    <ul style=“list-style-type:square”>
        <li>I think the whole experience is meant to be quite evergreen in the sense that you can experiment with creating a different ecosystem each time. With that being said, I believe each experiment would take 3-5 minutes and it’s scope would suggest it encourages players to come back and continue engaging with it in other experiments. However, without communicating objectives I was quite lost.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Week 3</h2>
    
    <h4>8) What metaphor or metaphors does the experience's mental model reference?</h4>

    <ul style=“list-style-type:square”>
        <li>It reminded me of Powder Toy, which is almost exactly the same concept. My experience with Powder Toy informed my interactions with this model.</li>
        <li>The digital metaphors it referenced were mainly ‘move element into active area’</li>
        <li>The mental model being used here is the giant fishbowl looking box in the centre of the screen indicating the user to use that active area for their ecosystem as, naturally, that’s where an ecosystem might be able to thrive.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>9) What does this reference suggest about how you should feel and/or act when engaging with it?</h4>

    <ul style=“list-style-type:square”>
        <li>The metaphors it references pertain to the human actions of growing an ecosystem by layering certain components appropriately and introducing wildlife at a specific time. The model works in the same way that if they want the wildlife to flourish and thrive, they must first layer the components through dragging and dropping into the designated area.</li>
        <li>It suggest you should feel accomplished when you see the ecosystem thriving.</li>
        <li>The skeuomorphic design principles in this model adhere almost to Apple’s ‘glass’ aesthetic in that everything feels like it could be conducted in a test tube for scientific studies. Everything is sanitised and pristine and primed for science.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>10) What is the most frustrating element of the interaction and what makes it frustrating to you?</h4>

    <ul style=“list-style-type:square”>
        <li>The lack of user knowledge over how the individual components need to be layered and interacted with made for a large window of experimentation where nothing was ever validated. This made it frustrating as I didn’t know if I was successful or if I needed to continue experimenting.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>11) What is the most satisfying element of the interaction and what makes it satisfying to you?</h4>

    <ul style=“list-style-type:square”>
        <li>The dragging and dropping mechanic had its own physics for each component. Sand dropped heavily. Water floated before it landed. Fish dived down and swam around. It made each interaction feel unique.</li>
    </ul>
